ACF interface for the OpenPDU project.

Connect the wires, and install this package.
Then go to https://[YOUR_IP], enter user/pass so you can login to ACF.
Under "OpenPDU" you can control your outlets.

DONE:
 * Basic Outlet Status (almost everything hardcoded :( )
 * Power control (ON/OFF) for each socket
 * All the outlets are powered ON on boot
 * ACF package
 * configuration file editing

TODO:
 * editing outlet parameters

BUGS:
 * At the moment, the "Edit" button doesn't work
